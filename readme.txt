A collection of customizations useful when allowing users to pay by check for Paid Memberships Pro levels.

== Description ==

Adds a radio option to checkout to pay by credit card or PayPal now or pay by check.

Users who choose to pay by check will have their order to "pending" status.

Users with a pending order will not have access based on their level.

After you receive and cash the check, you can edit the order to change the status to "success", which will give the user access.

An email is sent to the user RE the status change.
